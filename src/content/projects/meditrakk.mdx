This personal project is a web application designed to help patients with appointments and doctors with managing their patients. As the frontend developer, I implemented the design using Next.js. The user interface was built with ShadCN, providing a responsive and user-friendly design. I integrated interactive charts to visualize spending patterns. This project is ongoing, and I continuously add new features and improvements based on the clients feedback.
